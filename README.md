# Facebook-Recomending-System
A computer system that makes suggestions is called a recommender system. As background, there are two general approaches: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

Collaborative filtering (what we will implement) is a way of recommending things to you by comparing your preferences to other users. If your past preferences were similar to another user’s, then your future preferences may be as well. As a concrete example, suppose that you like John, Paul, and George. Other people like John, Paul, George, and also Ringo. Based on this information, it is likely that you will like Ringo as well, even if you had never previously heard of him. The recommender system does not have to understand anything about what “John”, “Paul”, “George”, and “Ringo” are — they could even be brands of toilet paper, and the algorithm would work identically.

Content-based filtering considers the characteristics of the things you like, and it recommends similar sorts of things. For instance, if you like “Billie Jean”, “Crazy Train”, and “Don’t Stop the Music”, then you might like other songs in the key of F-sharp minor, such as Rachmaninoff’s “Piano Concerto No. 1”, even if no one else has ever had that particular set of favorite songs before.
